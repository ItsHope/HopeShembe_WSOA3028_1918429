   <p> The internet has undergone a lot of trials and errors and there are a lot of revolutionary 
inventions that contributed to how we know it today. This writing will focus on one major 
moment, the invention of packet switching and its benefits. The invention that brought about 
the development of the first web browser, the WorldWideWeb. Packet switching can be 
defined as the transfer of sliced out small pieces of data (packets) across a wide range of 
networks. These packets travel via a medium that allows multiple users to do transmissions 
simultaneously (Davies, 2001).

<p>
After the giant ENIAC machine had been invented, the first significant computer (Hartree, 
1946) and smaller other ones later, there was notion in the technology fraternity regarding the 
means of sharing data from one computer to the next. Although there are a lot of names 
around packet switching as well as uncertainties regarding who came up with the idea first. 
Considering the time of events, Paul Baran was the first ever person to come up with the idea 
and execute it in the early 1960s. After graduating as an electrical engineer in 1959, Baran 
went to work for RAND Corporation and created a communication network.

A communication network that had divided communication streams that were message blocks 
or “packets” (National Inventors Hall Of Fame, 2007). This is what a package switching 
system is. Packet switching was not considered by the society then until the mid-late 60s. 
Packet switching started gaining traction when a team of developers at the National Physical 
Laboratory had arguably the same aspirations as Paul Baran, to transfer data over networks 
and make it convenient in terms of the amount of time the data will take to get to the other 
end. During that time, the phenomenon of transferring data was just being introduced with 
telephones by the Post Office, this was through circuit switching. With computers, it was
being introduced just not for communication purposes or rather it had not gained traction
(Paul Baran). 
</p>

<p>
Donald Davies a computer scientist employed at the National Physical 
Laboratory, while working at the labs observed that large frame computers would slice up 
programs for the benefit of the operators rather than having a long message on the line that 
caused a delay. He figured why not apply the same system for communication purposes. It is 
not known whether he had any influence from Baran’s work or not but upon realizing that, 
himself and a team started working on a prototype for the system in 1965. Packet switching 
meant that the transferring of data could be faster. They built this system and first it was 
operating just for the NPL. It was later considered by the Post Office and connecting 
networks began there (National Physical Lab, 2011).

</p>


<p>
Packet switching does not use a phone-like system like other methods, where only two 
networks can connect to one another at a time (Davies, 2001). As mentioned above, multiple 
users can do transmissions simultaneously to the same network. Packet switching is a 
significant moment because of how much it become a stepping stone for the creation of not 
just the www but other web browsers. There would have been no need of the www without
the interconnection from packet switching. A lot of people are on web for multiple reasons 
but sharing data over the internet especially to or from different networks at the same time is 
one of them. The www is the blueprint of all the web browsers we use today to access social 
media platforms that have taken the world by storm. Packet switching also contributed to 
why the web is considered one of the most impactful inventions. In the past, people would 
send letters to one another via the post office and hope the other person receives it. The 
chances of them not were great. 
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, although packet switching is not the only way of transferring data over 
networks, it has though proved to have made a huge contribution to how we know the
internet today, packet switching is efficient and has completely influenced how networks are 
being built today.
