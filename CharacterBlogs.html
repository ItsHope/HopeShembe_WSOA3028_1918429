            <h3>How I started doodling and how my love for it grew </h3>

            <p>
                When I was 14 years old my parents would let me do my online homeschool classes alone. At that time, we stayed in India, my parent’s favourite place to travel to. The normal was them leaving early in the morning and returning in the afternoon every single day. While they were out exploring cultural riches of India, documenting experiences for their blog. I would have to stay in the hotel room and attend my classes. 
            </p>
    
        <p>
    
            In the room, I always had to take notes while attending online, this is how it all started. With a book and pen in my hands for 2 hours max I could not help myself but doodle on my notebook. As the years progressed, my doodling got excessive. My doodling was not only in my notebooks but my actual exercise books. I was doing it while on the phone ordering a meal, I would do it while listening to music, while waiting for my parents to walk in and show me everything they documented. I was doodling every single day 
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            Doodling relaxed me and somehow will make me anxious. For a very long time, I did not believe how lucky I was to have discovered this, I was a genius. It was so sacred to me that I even kept it away from my parents. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Then came the time that my doodling was so excessive that like how most people need a certain amount of sleep, or need not to keep breakfast otherwise they will be off the whole day? That was doodling for me. I was starting to doodle on my bedroom walls. I needed to stop and I started to see my doodling in a negative light. I thought I had a problem. Like what I normally do when I encounter a problem, I looked up solutions on Google. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            On my research I found out about Mr Doodle, a 26 year old London doodler who has become a multi-million dollar auction sensation. At that time Mr Doodle was working with well established brands like Adidas, MTV to name a few. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            That is when the idea sparked that I could do that too, I had my own doodle style and once my parents found out about my doodling, my dad said while looking at one of the pages I doodled on “I would buy this, it is so interesting to look at”. With the support of my parents, I was able to sell about 50 doodle pieces that year

             <h4>What inspires my Art? </h4> 

             <p>

                What inspires my art is what’s around me. My environment is what inspires it, looking outside the window is what inspires my doodle art. Having lived in a lot of different countries I’ve seen how my doodle art has changed from city to city. My doodle art looked different when I was in India, when used to sit outside on a balcony looking out to the chaotic Mumbai compared to how it looks now. I live in South Africa now and I have been here for a while. Although I don’t get to interact with the people as much as I would want to, I sure do interact with the city and culture. When running errands I purposely take public transport so I can fully experience what it’s really like living in Johannesburg South Africa. It looks like most African cities I have been to, maybe a lot less chaotic but there is beauty in the city. I am currently working on a doodle album inspired by the CBD’s major service of transport, taxis.

             <h4>What I wish to do with this website.  </h4>

             <p> 
                This website is extremely sentimental to me. I look at it as a part of me. My digital doodle art pieces are up on this site. I get to make money doing what I want. Another goal of mine for this website, I want it to serve as educational. I want whoever lands on this site to leave with an idea of what doodle art is and hopefully I change their mind about how doodle art can be “real art” by about reading my story and journey.

                A few weeks ago I was delighted to find out that the city’s zoo, Johannesburg Zoo is wanting me to work with them on their most recent campaign. I was assigned to come visit the zoo a couple of times with the goal of taking as much pictures as I needed to start doodling on most of them. These art pieces will be used for their daily presentations that they conduct for visitors. They saw and liked my work and wanted inform and educate people about animals in a fun way, doodles are fun. Here are some of the pictures I took
