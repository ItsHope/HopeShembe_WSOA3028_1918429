        After the development of the internet, things were very different compared to how we know 
them now. Previously people would access the internet by clicking on buttons that led them to
essential specific things like their mails, the news or the weather. The way they accessed the 
web is completely different to how computers and smart phones today give access to the 
websites. This way of accessing the web went on until there were more and more independent 
web service providers that introduced web browsers. This essay will define what web browsers 
are, and exactly how they work.

    A web browser can simply be defined as an application or a software installed on a smartphone 
    or computer used to access webpages and websites (Manasa, 2011). Essentially web browsers 
    are used to make accessing the WorldWideWeb or websites easier. They are able to display 
    content from websites, for example highly used websites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube 
    and Pinterest by just going through various processes in a matter of a few seconds.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        Most major web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari to name a few include a 
        search bar that users can type in. Users can either type in a website’s URL like 
        www.twitter.com to be directed straight to the website or twitter to be directed to a search 
        engine like Google(for Google Chrome) with content or details about twitter usually having 
        the website’s for the web browser Chrome. How web browsers do this is actually fascinating 
        considering how fast output is delivered. Every website on the web uses a URL that has a web
        protocol called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is what allows the web client 
        which is the user’s computer and a web server to communicate.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a user hits the enter button, the browser in less than a minute locates a web servers that 
is storing the website in question. Using the domain within a URL which is the name of a 
website, See Figure 1 or an IP address. The browser will access a world-wide date bass called 
the Domain Name System to access an IP address that corresponds with the one the user sent 
out. After that, the web client, the computer or smartphone will connect with a server or servers 
for big websites, this is where the website is stored. This connection is over what we call a 
Transmission Control Protocol. 
       
    </p>

    <p>
        The computer basically sends a request over to the server to find out if the server’s ports are
open for new connections. That request will be followed by an acknowledgement from the 
server if the ports really are open, lastly the clients will return a notification that it has received 
the acknowledgement. The two have successfully established a connection and by the use of 
the protocol, the web client can receive the website in question. 
        
    </p>

    <p>
    It is however uncommon for this whole process to be this easy, especially for social media 
websites. Different websites are stored in a lot of servers, not just one. There usually are a lot 
of databases that a request needs to go through into to get to a server with the website. This 
though happens in a few minutes.


    </p>

    Ultimately the creation of browsers was a profound moment because of how easy it has made 
accessing the internet. Almost everyone today uses a browser to access the web, most devices, 
phones, computers and laptops are bought will browsers installed already. Through 
understanding what they do for users, how they do it and especially how fast they do it, one 
can justify just much of an impactful invention they are.
