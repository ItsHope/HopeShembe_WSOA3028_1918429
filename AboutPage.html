                Do you agree that the creation of art is spontaneous, it should not be planned? An art piece will be clear on how it is going to turn only when it's done? If you think about it, that’s the same with doodling, I never know how the page will look like until after I’m done, it’s always a surprise

            AB wears her hair in a medium sized afro that she always wears in a tied back style. She has chocolate shade, clear, and the same tone all around glowy skin. She has a round face with black eyes and pink lips. A body structure typical of an 18 year old. She loves white for clothing and everything in general which is why 70% of her art is in black and white.

            She is  18 yearrs old, a social media figure mostly known for her doodling art. AB stands for Aliyah (name meaning high or exalted) and Busi. Aliyah is a common Moroccan girl name is that she was given by her mom’s midwife. Despite a South African nationality, AB was born in Morocco. She does not remember much about her Moroccan life because as soon was old enough to understand anything she realised she was in India and leaving to South Africa, the next year.

            AB is an only child, she has been home schooled her whole life. Her childhood was a blur. All she remembers is that she always was given a laptop to play with every single day at 9am, just before class by her parents before they left to explore different locations for content for their blogs. It was fine at first but as time went by, her parents had to country hop way too often, they went from the grandest of countries to really poor developing countries. Her parents were taking tourist jobs in exchange for shelter and foods at some point after travel money had ran out.

            Finally her parents, had decided to make the decision to go back home to SA. They all three have been leaving in Johannesburg for the last 6 years. Due to being home schooled her whole life, AB has no to little social skills outside social media. Her social media is in fact impressive. Over the years, Aliyah has built the brand AB with her doodling art, savage clap backs and good looks is sitting at over 250 000 followers on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr combined.
