                Do you agree that the creation of art is spontaneous, it should not be planned? An art piece will be clear on how it is going turn out until it is done? If you think about it, that’s the same with doodling, I never know how the page will look like until after I’m done, it’s always a surprise

                  For me, the joy of doing it is doodling when I want to.
