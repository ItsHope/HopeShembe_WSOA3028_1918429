            <p>The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.

             <p>
                Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion amongst the people in the book that it was created by a God. People constantly flood the library to explore the content in the books. These people are called the librarian quests to explore  The library constantly has people in it exploring the indecipherable books   Borges expresses that this location is a fascination to humankind and that there are even conclusions that this is a creation by a God. People are constantly exploring the library, most people spend most if not all their lives in search of specific books. These people are called the librarians. Today’s “librarians” would be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and hacks on Google.
