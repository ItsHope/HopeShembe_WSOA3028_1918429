            The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.
