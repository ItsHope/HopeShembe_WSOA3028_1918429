            JavaScript is a widely used programming language and plays a major role on the worldwide web today. It plays a major role especially in the industry I am in. The creative industry. This essay will explore the development of JavaScript, how it works, and the benefits of it, especially for digital artists
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, an American software technologist who is also co-founded the Mozilla community (Aston, 2015). He came out with it while he was working at Nescafe Communications. Known first as Mocha, then LiveScript because it was said it livens up websites and internet applications in general, and finally named JavaScript (Krill, 2008). What is it? JavaScript can be described as a scripting language used to “create as well as control dynamic website content” (Morris, 2012). 
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in 1995, before well-known scripting languages were developed such as Java, Python and etc. It was born out of the desire for people, HTML authors to directly write scripts in their documents. In Erich’s words, “JavaScript was meant to be embedded directly into webpages, it was meant to be easy to use because everyone was creating their webpages at that time”. I feel JavaScript is important because a lot of people are creating their webpages a lot more than they were in the 1990s. How it works is, it is embedded into webpages simply with use of script tags or is included in a js.file. This is beneficial especially for people who have little background with programming for interactivity on their websites. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Interactivity in general is incorporated in most common websites and implements great user interface, whether it is graphical UI or touch UI. Interactivity has become a standard for internet applications. In this day and age more and more people are creating websites, including everyday people. JavaScript means they can also implement and achieve interactivity which has become a standard in what makes a good website or what is considered good user experience. For example, most websites include auto complete text suggestions.

        <p>
            Apart from interactivity, there are many other benefits of JavaScript like being able to be understood by a web browser, it does not necessarily need to be on a server like a lot of languages. There are also frame works that were built and allow developers especially mobile application developers to have direct connection to smartphone APIs and enable access to the phone’s camera, location and etc. However what I feel has been a benefit to my industry is the one aspect of the interactivity that JavaScript offers. Animating, JavaScript can give the website’s content some movement from animated graphics to slideshows and etc. Ordinary digital artists need websites to sell their work, because they are selling themselves, they often need to include features like a slideshow of their work, ultimately a good dosage of interactivity, example Harriet Stewart website <a href="http://www.hattiestewart.com/work/work-2/">Website here</a>
        </p>

        <p>

            In conclusion JavaScript is a scripting language used usually coupled up with other languages, it’s considered easy and was created by Brendan Eich in only 10 days but it has proved to be very significant, because of its benefits. It is used in the most big internet platforms today such as twitter and Facebook (Edutechnional,2018). As an artist considering going digital and creating digital doodle art pieces, I am confident that I will be able to easily include my personality, a few pop ups here and there in my website and implement good user experience with anime.js once I have the HTML structure.
