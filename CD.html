Aliyah is a common Moroccan girl name is that she was given by her momâ€™s midwife. Despite a South African nationality, AB was born in Morocco. She does not remember much about her Moroccan life because as soon was old enough to understand anything she realised she was in India and leaving to South Africa, the next year.

            AB is an only child, she has been home schooled her whole life. Her childhood was a blur. All she remembers is that she always was given a laptop to play with every single day at 9am, just before class by her parents before they left to explore different locations for content for their blogs. It was fine at first but as time went by, her parents had to country hop way too often, they went from the grandest of countries to really poor developing countries. Her parents were taking tourist jobs in exchange for shelter and foods at some point after travel money had ran out.

            Finally her parents, had decided to make the decision to go back home to SA. They all three have been leaving in Johannesburg for the last 6 years. Due to being home schooled her whole life, AB has no to little social skills outside social media. Her social media is in fact impressive. Over the years, Aliyah has built the brand AB with her doodling art, savage clap backs and good looks is sitting at over 250 000 followers on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr combined.
