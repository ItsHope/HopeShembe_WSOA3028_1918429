        Metadata often defined as “data about data” is essential for anyone looking to find out more
information about a piece of work, metadata is widely used in various industries, especially the 
technology industry but the definition “data about data” is vague for a person who does not 
work with data regularly. This essay will critically define metadata by discussing 3 main types 
of metadata, Descriptive, Structural as well as Administrative. Discuss some of the uses of 
Meta Data, what they are, why and how with examples. 
    </p>

        Literally metadata indeed is data about data, these are facts or details surrounding a piece of 
information to help get a better idea of that piece of information. Meta data makes 
understanding a piece of information easier. As mentioned above, there are 3 main types of 
metadata, Descriptive, Administrative and Structural. Descriptive metadata is data that relates 
to a piece of information, through describing the piece of information, it tells us more about it.
For example on a website, an image that appears would be data and the title of the image is 
data that describes the image, data about data. “Descriptive metadata is used to identify and 
authenticate” (Barca, 2016). 
    </p>

        Secondly, Administrative metadata is data about a piece of information that helps manage it 
with details like when and how it was developed, the file type generally technical information, 
so it consists both technical metadata and preservation metadata (Puglia, Reed and Rhodes, 
2004). Lastly, Structural metadata. Structural metadata, relates to many things, it tells us how
bits of information are stored and what they mean. For example, as mentioned above 
descriptive metadata would describe an image, identify its location and the time it was taken 
etc. Structural metadata would be prediction of what the location and time of several pictures 
mean. By linking all of this data and coming up with a list or table that has fills up data about 
several data, one would have come up with Structural metadata.

        Metadata has multiple uses, people or industries can use metadata especially when it comes to 
for recreation, reuse or recontextualisation (Barca, 2016). With a lot of objects, there usually 
is a need to preserve them, research about them, rehabilitate about them etc. To do this, usually 
objects will be converted into a digital format, this where the importance of descriptive data
comes in like the file type, who created the time and when, administrative data as well. For 
example, when paintings are captured and converted into digital images or online pictures.

        One of the major functions of metadata is classification and managing or “organization or 
description” (Barca, 2016). Using metadata and with metadata, original objects can be 
classified and categorized to make looking for information easier as well as understanding data better because of the type of description it falls under. One can get a better understanding about 
a book when they have details like the subjects it covers, who wrote it and etc.

        Lastly validation, users can scrutinize data, metadata as well any other features of resources to 
achieve a level of legitimacy, ascertain the trustworthiness and authoritativeness of those 
particular resources (Barca, 2016). Those details that metadata offers are profound when 
someone is looking to present their research about a piece of work and have it gain a level of 
authority

        The term of metadata is widely used, metadata is so important. Types of metadata were 
discussed, administrative, descriptive and structural. Some of uses of metadata were looked 
into with examples, in conclusion although this essay only scratched the surface of how 
important and powerful metadata is and how much it is essential for a lot of industries to even 
be possible, an insight of what, its uses and how metadata can be used was given.
