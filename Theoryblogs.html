        The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.

       Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.

       The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.

       Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for.

       In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.
