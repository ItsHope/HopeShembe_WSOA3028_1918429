        <h3> Reflection on The Library of Babel by Borges</h3>

        <p>The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.
        </p>

        <p>
           Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.
        </p> 

        <p>
           The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.  
        </p>

        <p>
           Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for. 
       
        </p>

        <p>
           In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.

            Development of JavaScript
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            JavaScript is a widely used programming language and plays a major role on the worldwide web today. It plays a major role especially in the industry I am in. The creative industry. This essay will explore the development of JavaScript, how it works, and the benefits of it, especially for digital artists
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, an American software technologist who is also co-founded the Mozilla community (Aston, 2015). He came out with it while he was working at Nescafe Communications. Known first as Mocha, then LiveScript because it was said it livens up websites and internet applications in general, and finally named JavaScript (Krill, 2008). What is it? JavaScript can be described as a scripting language used to “create as well as control dynamic website content” (Morris, 2012). 
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in 1995, before well-known scripting languages were developed such as Java, Python and etc. It was born out of the desire for people, HTML authors to directly write scripts in their documents. In Erich’s words, “JavaScript was meant to be embedded directly into webpages, it was meant to be easy to use because everyone was creating their webpages at that time”. I feel JavaScript is important because a lot of people are creating their webpages a lot more than they were in the 1990s. How it works is, it is embedded into webpages simply with use of script tags or is included in a js.file. This is beneficial especially for people who have little background with programming for interactivity on their websites. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Interactivity in general is incorporated in most common websites and implements great user interface, whether it is graphical UI or touch UI. Interactivity has become a standard for internet applications. In this day and age more and more people are creating websites, including everyday people. JavaScript means they can also implement and achieve interactivity which has become a standard in what makes a good website or what is considered good user experience. For example, most websites include auto complete text suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from interactivity, there are many other benefits of JavaScript like being able to be understood by a web browser, it does not necessarily need to be on a server like a lot of languages. There are also frame works that were built and allow developers especially mobile application developers to have direct connection to smartphone APIs and enable access to the phone’s camera, location and etc. However what I feel has been a benefit to my industry is the one aspect of the interactivity that JavaScript offers. Animating, JavaScript can give the website’s content some movement from animated graphics to slideshows and etc. Ordinary digital artists need websites to sell their work, because they are selling themselves, they often need to include features like a slideshow of their work, ultimately a good dosage of interactivity, example Harriet Stewart website <a href="http://www.hattiestewart.com/work/work-2/">Website here</a>
        </p>

        <p>

            In conclusion JavaScript is a scripting language used usually coupled up with other languages, it’s considered easy and was created by Brendan Eich in only 10 days but it has proved to be very significant, because of its benefits. It is used in the most big internet platforms today such as twitter and Facebook (Edutechnional,2018). As an artist considering going digital and creating digital doodle art pieces, I am confident that I will be able to easily include my personality, a few pop ups here and there in my website and implement good user experience with anime.js once I have the HTML structure.

        <h3>
            
                What is a browser and how do they work?
        
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            After the development of the internet, things were very different compared to how we know 
    them now. Previously people would access the internet by clicking on buttons that led them to
    essential specific things like their mails, the news or the weather. The way they accessed the 
    web is completely different to how computers and smart phones today give access to the 
    websites. This way of accessing the web went on until there were more and more independent 
    web service providers that introduced web browsers. This essay will define what web browsers 
    are, and exactly how they work.
           
        </p>
    
        <p>
        A web browser can simply be defined as an application or a software installed on a smartphone 
        or computer used to access webpages and websites (Manasa, 2011). Essentially web browsers 
        are used to make accessing the WorldWideWeb or websites easier. They are able to display 
        content from websites, for example highly used websites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube 
        and Pinterest by just going through various processes in a matter of a few seconds.
        
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Most major web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari to name a few include a 
            search bar that users can type in. Users can either type in a website’s URL like 
            www.twitter.com to be directed straight to the website or twitter to be directed to a search 
            engine like Google(for Google Chrome) with content or details about twitter usually having 
            the website’s for the web browser Chrome. How web browsers do this is actually fascinating 
            considering how fast output is delivered. Every website on the web uses a URL that has a web
            protocol called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is what allows the web client 
            which is the user’s computer and a web server to communicate.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            After a user hits the enter button, the browser in less than a minute locates a web servers that 
    is storing the website in question. Using the domain within a URL which is the name of a 
    website, See Figure 1 or an IP address. The browser will access a world-wide date bass called 
    the Domain Name System to access an IP address that corresponds with the one the user sent 
    out. After that, the web client, the computer or smartphone will connect with a server or servers 
    for big websites, this is where the website is stored. This connection is over what we call a 
    Transmission Control Protocol. 
           
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The computer basically sends a request over to the server to find out if the server’s ports are
    open for new connections. That request will be followed by an acknowledgement from the 
    server if the ports really are open, lastly the clients will return a notification that it has received 
    the acknowledgement. The two have successfully established a connection and by the use of 
    the protocol, the web client can receive the website in question. 
            
        </p>
    
        <p>
        It is however uncommon for this whole process to be this easy, especially for social media 
    websites. Different websites are stored in a lot of servers, not just one. There usually are a lot 
    of databases that a request needs to go through into to get to a server with the website. This 
    though happens in a few minutes.
    
    
        </p>
            
           
        <p>
        Ultimately the creation of browsers was a profound moment because of how easy it has made 
    accessing the internet. Almost everyone today uses a browser to access the web, most devices, 
    phones, computers and laptops are bought will browsers installed already. Through 
    understanding what they do for users, how they do it and especially how fast they do it, one 
    can justify just much of an impactful invention they are.

        <h3>How does The Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web?</h3>


        <p>
            The Medium is the message is a phrase by a philosopher Marshall McLuhan. According to 
            McLuhan, the Medium is the message means that the medium in which a message is 
            communicated through has more influence than the message itself. (McLuhan, 1964)
            Nevertheless is the message’s relevance in influencing whoever is accessing it at that point, 
            even if it is at an extent.
            
           </p> 
        
         <p>
            To illustrate his theory and how much a medium can generally have influence. He takes 
            listening to a message and reading the same message from a printing. He expresses that the 
            printed words encourage an emphasis on the visual while hearing the same message being 
            given orally makes the ear the dominant organ. (McLuhan, 1969).
            
         </p>
    
        <p>
    
            McLuhan developed his theory around his time, the 1960s using only mediums like 
    television, radio and printing to test and prove his theory. Even though McLuhan did not live 
    to see the internet or web that is this modern age mass medium, his theory can still be tested
    especially on such a multifaceted medium. The web is a combination of different types of 
    mediums, people can access pictures, audio and text on it. 
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
    
            A lot of people consider the internet a place, some may say the internet is their favourite 
    place. People can access the web anywhere and anytime with the use of usually a mobile 
    device. Like most places, the internet has people, there is human virtual interaction, 
    especially on social media networks. There are millions of people on Facebook today who 
    can connect to one another all around the world. 
            
        
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            To understand the web and what this worldwide connection means for us and its influence we 
    can look at McLuhan’s words when explaining his phrase around television, telephones and 
    radio. McLuhan said such mediums unify and encourage participation amongst people. A 
    sense of unity on the internet cannot be denied, with the revolution of the internet, there has 
    been new phenomena like hashtags. Hashtags are tags that different people can use to access 
    the same information. Recently here has been a liking amongst social media users to use them 
    specifically for raising awareness for a particular cause. Hashtags do well playing that role 
    because they can reach a huge amount of people in a short period of time, for example, 
    #feesmustfall, #blacklivesmatter, etc. 
        </p>
    
    
        <p>
    
            Campaign hashtags usually take the internet by storm, they can be seen being used by small 
    accounts as well as very big accounts on social media. The web as a medium influence human behavior, a lot of people participated in #feesmustfall. One could argue if 
    participation was because of the message for the majority of the people or did the reality of 
    being a social media user just meant that they had to post, repost or retweet this hashtag like 
    how people do hashtags.
        </p>
    
        <p>
    
            What does raising awareness mean? Why can a message not be sent to the relevant people? 
    What does a lot of people uniting for a cause really do? What’s the influence?
    
        </p>
        
    
        <p>
    
            We can understand exactly how much a medium can have influence or how much its 
    conventions like sharing a campaign hashtag can have influence an ordinary social media 
    user’s behavior to conform. “It was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale 
    and form of human association and action” (McLuhan, 1964). This influence can even be 
    seen on the relevant people in society that can make a difference towards the specific 
    campaign. Arguably people care when it is on social media and would have probably acted 
    completely different if the fees must fall message was communicated through a traditional 
    medium like radio for example. The web is a powerful tool with that being said a medium can 
    have influence.

    <h3>
        The uses of Metadata, what, why and how 
    </h3>

    <p>
        Metadata often defined as “data about data” is essential for anyone looking to find out more
information about a piece of work, metadata is widely used in various industries, especially the 
technology industry but the definition “data about data” is vague for a person who does not 
work with data regularly. This essay will critically define metadata by discussing 3 main types 
of metadata, Descriptive, Structural as well as Administrative. Discuss some of the uses of 
Meta Data, what they are, why and how with examples. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Literally metadata indeed is data about data, these are facts or details surrounding a piece of 
information to help get a better idea of that piece of information. Meta data makes 
understanding a piece of information easier. As mentioned above, there are 3 main types of 
metadata, Descriptive, Administrative and Structural. Descriptive metadata is data that relates 
to a piece of information, through describing the piece of information, it tells us more about it.
For example on a website, an image that appears would be data and the title of the image is 
data that describes the image, data about data. “Descriptive metadata is used to identify and 
authenticate” (Barca, 2016). 
    </p>

    <p>

        Secondly, Administrative metadata is data about a piece of information that helps manage it 
with details like when and how it was developed, the file type generally technical information, 
so it consists both technical metadata and preservation metadata (Puglia, Reed and Rhodes, 
2004). Lastly, Structural metadata. Structural metadata, relates to many things, it tells us how
bits of information are stored and what they mean. For example, as mentioned above 
descriptive metadata would describe an image, identify its location and the time it was taken 
etc. Structural metadata would be prediction of what the location and time of several pictures 
mean. By linking all of this data and coming up with a list or table that has fills up data about 
several data, one would have come up with Structural metadata.

    </p>


    <p>

        Metadata has multiple uses, people or industries can use metadata especially when it comes to 
for recreation, reuse or recontextualisation (Barca, 2016). With a lot of objects, there usually 
is a need to preserve them, research about them, rehabilitate about them etc. To do this, usually 
objects will be converted into a digital format, this where the importance of descriptive data
comes in like the file type, who created the time and when, administrative data as well. For 
example, when paintings are captured and converted into digital images or online pictures. 
    </p>


    <p>
        One of the major functions of metadata is classification and managing or “organization or 
description” (Barca, 2016). Using metadata and with metadata, original objects can be 
classified and categorized to make looking for information easier as well as understanding data better because of the type of description it falls under. One can get a better understanding about 
a book when they have details like the subjects it covers, who wrote it and etc. 
    </p>


    <p>

        Lastly validation, users can scrutinize data, metadata as well any other features of resources to 
achieve a level of legitimacy, ascertain the trustworthiness and authoritativeness of those 
particular resources (Barca, 2016). Those details that metadata offers are profound when 
someone is looking to present their research about a piece of work and have it gain a level of 
authority
    </p>


    <p>

        The term of metadata is widely used, metadata is so important. Types of metadata were 
discussed, administrative, descriptive and structural. Some of uses of metadata were looked 
into with examples, in conclusion although this essay only scratched the surface of how 
important and powerful metadata is and how much it is essential for a lot of industries to even 
be possible, an insight of what, its uses and how metadata can be used was given.

            Packet Switching in the 1960s
        </h3>

        <p> The internet has undergone a lot of trials and errors and there are a lot of revolutionary 
            inventions that contributed to how we know it today. This writing will focus on one major 
            moment, the invention of packet switching and its benefits. The invention that brought about 
            the development of the first web browser, the WorldWideWeb. Packet switching can be 
            defined as the transfer of sliced out small pieces of data (packets) across a wide range of 
            networks. These packets travel via a medium that allows multiple users to do transmissions 
            simultaneously (Davies, 2001).

            After the giant ENIAC machine had been invented, the first significant computer (Hartree, 
            1946) and smaller other ones later, there was notion in the technology fraternity regarding the 
            means of sharing data from one computer to the next. Although there are a lot of names 
            around packet switching as well as uncertainties regarding who came up with the idea first. 
            Considering the time of events, Paul Baran was the first ever person to come up with the idea 
            and execute it in the early 1960s. After graduating as an electrical engineer in 1959, Baran 
            went to work for RAND Corporation and created a communication network.

            A communication network that had divided communication streams that were message blocks 
            or “packets” (National Inventors Hall Of Fame, 2007). This is what a package switching 
            system is. Packet switching was not considered by the society then until the mid-late 60s. 
            Packet switching started gaining traction when a team of developers at the National Physical 
            Laboratory had arguably the same aspirations as Paul Baran, to transfer data over networks 
            and make it convenient in terms of the amount of time the data will take to get to the other 
            end. During that time, the phenomenon of transferring data was just being introduced with 
            telephones by the Post Office, this was through circuit switching. With computers, it was
            being introduced just not for communication purposes or rather it had not gained traction
            (Paul Baran).

            Donald Davies a computer scientist employed at the National Physical 
            Laboratory, while working at the labs observed that large frame computers would slice up 
            programs for the benefit of the operators rather than having a long message on the line that 
            caused a delay. He figured why not apply the same system for communication purposes. It is 
            not known whether he had any influence from Baran’s work or not but upon realizing that, 
            himself and a team started working on a prototype for the system in 1965. Packet switching 
            meant that the transferring of data could be faster. They built this system and first it was 
            operating just for the NPL. It was later considered by the Post Office and connecting 
            networks began there (National Physical Lab, 2011).

            <p>
            Packet switching does not use a phone-like system like other methods, where only two 
            networks can connect to one another at a time (Davies, 2001). As mentioned above, multiple 
            users can do transmissions simultaneously to the same network. Packet switching is a 
            significant moment because of how much it become a stepping stone for the creation of not 
            just the www but other web browsers. There would have been no need of the www without
            the interconnection from packet switching. A lot of people are on web for multiple reasons 
            but sharing data over the internet especially to or from different networks at the same time is 
            one of them. The www is the blueprint of all the web browsers we use today to access social 
            media platforms that have taken the world by storm. Packet switching also contributed to 
            why the web is considered one of the most impactful inventions. In the past, people would 
            send letters to one another via the post office and hope the other person receives it. The 
            chances of them not were great. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            In conclusion, although packet switching is not the only way of transferring data over 
            networks, it has though proved to have made a huge contribution to how we know the
            internet today, packet switching is efficient and has completely influenced how networks are 
            being built today.

        <h3>What is/are digital divides and how do they affect us/you?</h3>

        <p>
            Simply put the digital divide can be described as the difference between people who have access to the internet and those who do not. This essay will explore the concept of Digital divide and the three levels of it. One being the spread and access to the internet, two, the level of digital skills and lastly the consequences or impacts of the divide, especially on the disadvantaged group (third level of digital divide).  

        </p>

        <p>

            A digital divide is an economic and social inequality to access or the impact of information and communication technologies. It is commonly described as the global digital divide as it more evident amongst countries, developing and developed countries. However, the digital divide can also be between individuals, households, geographic areas that are usually at different socioeconomic levels. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This digital divide is also usually referred to as a technological gap. A YouTube video, titled “Digital Divide in South Africa” by Ahmed Mahroogi demonstrates what this divide is and its effects using two characters. Chris and John, two male teenagers with the same age in High school. John is of white ethnicity while Chris is a person of colour. Different to Chris, John lives in the United States of America, a developed country while Chris stays in South Africa, a developing country. They both had the same dream after school, to be businessmen. After they both graduated from tertiary education, John quickly got a job at a business company while Chris found it difficult to get hired anywhere. Chris simply did not meet job requirements that include the computer proficiency, Microsoft office proficiency and etc. Ahmed goes on to give insight on Chris’s background, Chris is from lower socio-economic status. ‘’Traditionally disadvantaged citizens are similarly disadvantaged on the internet” (reference) Chris did not while growing up or does not have a sufficient access to the internet. This the first level of the digital divide.  
        </p>
        
        <p>

            Chris also does not qualify for the jobs he applies for because he only knows how to “print papers and use Google” (Mahroogi, 2015). This is the second level of the digital divide. These are the inequalities that go beyond just accessing the internet, these are inabilities. Digital inabilities to use ICTS, to participate and even enjoy the benefits of living in the digital era (B chi & Vogler, 2017; Hargittai & Shaw, 2013 as cited in Ragnedda, Massimo and Kreitem, Hanna 2018). With this digital divide, disadvantaged groups reap no benefits, unequal benefits or fewer compared to privileged groups. What this means describes the last level. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The last level relates to the effects of these inequalities. The inequalities in the tangible benefits between the two characters. John was hired and able to be what he always wanted to be, a business men. Chris however struggled to find a job and is currently unemployed. This is how the digital divides affects lives. Chris worked as hard as John to finish high school, get into University and graduate, he is technically as qualified as John but because of being disadvantaged he does not have arguably crucial skills that are required in the working industry.
