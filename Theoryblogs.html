        <h3> Reflection on The Library of Babel by Borges</h3>

        <p>The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.
        </p>

        <p>
           Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.
        </p> 

        <p>
           The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.  
        </p>

        <p>
           Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for. 
       
        </p>

        <p>
           In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.

            Development of JavaScript
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            JavaScript is a widely used programming language and plays a major role on the worldwide web today. It plays a major role especially in the industry I am in. The creative industry. This essay will explore the development of JavaScript, how it works, and the benefits of it, especially for digital artists
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, an American software technologist who is also co-founded the Mozilla community (Aston, 2015). He came out with it while he was working at Nescafe Communications. Known first as Mocha, then LiveScript because it was said it livens up websites and internet applications in general, and finally named JavaScript (Krill, 2008). What is it? JavaScript can be described as a scripting language used to “create as well as control dynamic website content” (Morris, 2012). 
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in 1995, before well-known scripting languages were developed such as Java, Python and etc. It was born out of the desire for people, HTML authors to directly write scripts in their documents. In Erich’s words, “JavaScript was meant to be embedded directly into webpages, it was meant to be easy to use because everyone was creating their webpages at that time”. I feel JavaScript is important because a lot of people are creating their webpages a lot more than they were in the 1990s. How it works is, it is embedded into webpages simply with use of script tags or is included in a js.file. This is beneficial especially for people who have little background with programming for interactivity on their websites. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Interactivity in general is incorporated in most common websites and implements great user interface, whether it is graphical UI or touch UI. Interactivity has become a standard for internet applications. In this day and age more and more people are creating websites, including everyday people. JavaScript means they can also implement and achieve interactivity which has become a standard in what makes a good website or what is considered good user experience. For example, most websites include auto complete text suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from interactivity, there are many other benefits of JavaScript like being able to be understood by a web browser, it does not necessarily need to be on a server like a lot of languages. There are also frame works that were built and allow developers especially mobile application developers to have direct connection to smartphone APIs and enable access to the phone’s camera, location and etc. However what I feel has been a benefit to my industry is the one aspect of the interactivity that JavaScript offers. Animating, JavaScript can give the website’s content some movement from animated graphics to slideshows and etc. Ordinary digital artists need websites to sell their work, because they are selling themselves, they often need to include features like a slideshow of their work, ultimately a good dosage of interactivity, example Harriet Stewart website <a href="http://www.hattiestewart.com/work/work-2/">Website here</a>
        </p>

        <p>

            In conclusion JavaScript is a scripting language used usually coupled up with other languages, it’s considered easy and was created by Brendan Eich in only 10 days but it has proved to be very significant, because of its benefits. It is used in the most big internet platforms today such as twitter and Facebook (Edutechnional,2018). As an artist considering going digital and creating digital doodle art pieces, I am confident that I will be able to easily include my personality, a few pop ups here and there in my website and implement good user experience with anime.js once I have the HTML structure.

           In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.

        <p>The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.
        </p>

        <p>
           Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.
        </p> 

        <p>
           The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.  
        </p>

        <p>
           Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for.
