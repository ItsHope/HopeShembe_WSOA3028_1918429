        <h3> Reflection on The Library of Babel by Borges</h3>

        <p>The library of Babel is a book by Borges that describes a mysterious fictional library that I thought showed similar characteristics with the internet and the relationship modern day people have with the web. One could actually go ahead and assume that Borges predicted the internet as we know it today and what that would mean for us. In the book, Borges extensively describes this location, it is made up of infinite hexagonal libraries that are lined up identical. This library contained all books, books from the past and all those that were going to be written in the future. Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.
        </p>

        <p>
           Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.
        </p> 

        <p>
           The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.  
        </p>

        <p>
           Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for. 
       
        </p>

        <p>
           In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.

            Development of JavaScript
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            JavaScript is a widely used programming language and plays a major role on the worldwide web today. It plays a major role especially in the industry I am in. The creative industry. This essay will explore the development of JavaScript, how it works, and the benefits of it, especially for digital artists
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, an American software technologist who is also co-founded the Mozilla community (Aston, 2015). He came out with it while he was working at Nescafe Communications. Known first as Mocha, then LiveScript because it was said it livens up websites and internet applications in general, and finally named JavaScript (Krill, 2008). What is it? JavaScript can be described as a scripting language used to “create as well as control dynamic website content” (Morris, 2012). 
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript was developed in 1995, before well-known scripting languages were developed such as Java, Python and etc. It was born out of the desire for people, HTML authors to directly write scripts in their documents. In Erich’s words, “JavaScript was meant to be embedded directly into webpages, it was meant to be easy to use because everyone was creating their webpages at that time”. I feel JavaScript is important because a lot of people are creating their webpages a lot more than they were in the 1990s. How it works is, it is embedded into webpages simply with use of script tags or is included in a js.file. This is beneficial especially for people who have little background with programming for interactivity on their websites. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Interactivity in general is incorporated in most common websites and implements great user interface, whether it is graphical UI or touch UI. Interactivity has become a standard for internet applications. In this day and age more and more people are creating websites, including everyday people. JavaScript means they can also implement and achieve interactivity which has become a standard in what makes a good website or what is considered good user experience. For example, most websites include auto complete text suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from interactivity, there are many other benefits of JavaScript like being able to be understood by a web browser, it does not necessarily need to be on a server like a lot of languages. There are also frame works that were built and allow developers especially mobile application developers to have direct connection to smartphone APIs and enable access to the phone’s camera, location and etc. However what I feel has been a benefit to my industry is the one aspect of the interactivity that JavaScript offers. Animating, JavaScript can give the website’s content some movement from animated graphics to slideshows and etc. Ordinary digital artists need websites to sell their work, because they are selling themselves, they often need to include features like a slideshow of their work, ultimately a good dosage of interactivity, example Harriet Stewart website <a href="http://www.hattiestewart.com/work/work-2/">Website here</a>
        </p>

        <p>

            In conclusion JavaScript is a scripting language used usually coupled up with other languages, it’s considered easy and was created by Brendan Eich in only 10 days but it has proved to be very significant, because of its benefits. It is used in the most big internet platforms today such as twitter and Facebook (Edutechnional,2018). As an artist considering going digital and creating digital doodle art pieces, I am confident that I will be able to easily include my personality, a few pop ups here and there in my website and implement good user experience with anime.js once I have the HTML structure.

        <p>
            After the development of the internet, things were very different compared to how we know 
    them now. Previously people would access the internet by clicking on buttons that led them to
    essential specific things like their mails, the news or the weather. The way they accessed the 
    web is completely different to how computers and smart phones today give access to the 
    websites. This way of accessing the web went on until there were more and more independent 
    web service providers that introduced web browsers. This essay will define what web browsers 
    are, and exactly how they work.
           
        </p>
    
        <p>
        A web browser can simply be defined as an application or a software installed on a smartphone 
        or computer used to access webpages and websites (Manasa, 2011). Essentially web browsers 
        are used to make accessing the WorldWideWeb or websites easier. They are able to display 
        content from websites, for example highly used websites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube 
        and Pinterest by just going through various processes in a matter of a few seconds.
        
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Most major web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari to name a few include a 
            search bar that users can type in. Users can either type in a website’s URL like 
            www.twitter.com to be directed straight to the website or twitter to be directed to a search 
            engine like Google(for Google Chrome) with content or details about twitter usually having 
            the website’s for the web browser Chrome. How web browsers do this is actually fascinating 
            considering how fast output is delivered. Every website on the web uses a URL that has a web
            protocol called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is what allows the web client 
            which is the user’s computer and a web server to communicate.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            After a user hits the enter button, the browser in less than a minute locates a web servers that 
    is storing the website in question. Using the domain within a URL which is the name of a 
    website, See Figure 1 or an IP address. The browser will access a world-wide date bass called 
    the Domain Name System to access an IP address that corresponds with the one the user sent 
    out. After that, the web client, the computer or smartphone will connect with a server or servers 
    for big websites, this is where the website is stored. This connection is over what we call a 
    Transmission Control Protocol. 
           
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The computer basically sends a request over to the server to find out if the server’s ports are
    open for new connections. That request will be followed by an acknowledgement from the 
    server if the ports really are open, lastly the clients will return a notification that it has received 
    the acknowledgement. The two have successfully established a connection and by the use of 
    the protocol, the web client can receive the website in question. 
            
        </p>
    
        <p>
        It is however uncommon for this whole process to be this easy, especially for social media 
    websites. Different websites are stored in a lot of servers, not just one. There usually are a lot 
    of databases that a request needs to go through into to get to a server with the website. This 
    though happens in a few minutes.
    
    
        </p>
            
           
        <p>
        Ultimately the creation of browsers was a profound moment because of how easy it has made 
    accessing the internet. Almost everyone today uses a browser to access the web, most devices, 
    phones, computers and laptops are bought will browsers installed already. Through 
    understanding what they do for users, how they do it and especially how fast they do it, one 
    can justify just much of an impactful invention they are.

Similar to the internet, the library of Babel was enormous, Borges actually described it as endless.

           Each hexagon in the library contains 20 bookshelves. No two books in the entire library are the same. Each book contains content that the next does not therefore, every book on a shelf inside the library is as significant as the one next to it. This library is a fascination to humankind and there is notion that it was created by a God (Borges, 1998). The library constantly has people flooding it to explore the books. These people are known as the librarians (Borges, 1998). The librarians dedicate most if not all of their lives in the library on quests. Sleep rooms and bathrooms are on every hexagonal library which encouraged long stays. In today’s context, librarians are regular people who work in libraries during office hours, similar to book keepers. The closest representation of the librarians today would actually be everyday people that have access to the internet looking up recipes and life hacks on Google.

           The librarians would go on quests to find special books that were said to have the secrets of life, personal vindications and etc. Librarians could stay in the library for as long as they want considering physical needs like the use of the bathroom and sleeping were catered for. The means of accessing all the knowledge the library could offer was definitely not hard. This is the same type of relationship a regular person with a mobile phone or desktop has with the web. They can access any type of knowledge anytime they want. The means to do so is at their fingertips.

        <p>
           Although there were all these books in the library, the librarians would mostly not succeed in their quests. The books were odd, the letters on the cover of a book had no relevance to what the book will say and these books were undecipherable with odd symbols. For many years, the librarians believed that the impenetrable books were in an ancient or far-distant language that they did not understand. They assumed that the first ever librarians employed a different language from the one they use. The librarians described the book as unintelligible. This notion of confusion must have been similar to the group of web developers and designers that were invited to a convention in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the development of the WWW in 2019. The developers were given the chance to experience the first browser ever launched (CERN, 2019). The browser was so different to the ones we know now, I launched it myself online and found it hard to navigate through and hard to understand the design choices the developers went for.

           In conclusion, the fictional library in Borges’s book has similar characteristics to the internet as we know it today. Characteristics such as both being huge sources of knowledge, how accessible they both are to the people around them and what they mean to them. The librarian’s fascination with the library is the same I have when I think about what the web means to me, an enormous world I can explore and get answers from despite not understanding the execution of the first ever browser created.
